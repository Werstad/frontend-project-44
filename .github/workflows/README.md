# Automatic tests
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/7cdd7c9ee9ef10331f0f/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Werstad/frontend-project-44/maintainability)

After completing all the steps in the project, automatic tests will become available to you. Tests are run on each commit - once all tasks in the Hexlet interface are completed, make a commit, and the tests will run automatically.

The hexlet-check.yml file is responsible for running these tests - do not delete this file, edit it, or rename the repository.
